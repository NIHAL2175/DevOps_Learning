# 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-style backup and disaster recovery solution** using **Amazon S3**.

The objective is to protect critical application files and configuration files by securely storing backups in Amazon S3 and restoring them whenever data loss occurs.

The project simulates a real-world production incident where application files are accidentally deleted from the server and are successfully recovered using Amazon S3 backups.

# 🚨 Incident Scenario

During routine maintenance, the application server experienced accidental deletion of local files.

Deleted Items

```
application/

config/
```

Impact

- Application files unavailable

- Configuration files missing

- Recovery required

Fortunately, a backup already existed inside Amazon S3.

---

# 🔍 Investigation

## Verify Local Files

```powershell
tree /F
```

Result

```
application/

config/
```

Files missing.

---

## Verify Backup

```powershell
aws s3 ls s3://nihal-s3-backup-solution-928974129633 --recursive
```

Result

```
application/app.txt

config/application.properties
```

Backup available.

```powershell
aws s3 cp s3://nihal-s3-backup-solution-928974129633/config config --recursive
```

---

# ✅ Validation

Verify project

```powershell
tree /F
```

Verify application

```powershell
type application\app.txt
```

Verify configuration

```powershell

# 🎯 Key Learnings

- Amazon S3 provides highly durable backup storage.
- Disaster recovery should always be tested, not just implemented.
- Regular backups minimize recovery time.
- AWS CLI enables repeatable backup automation.
- Backup verification is as important as backup creation.
- Recovery procedures should be documented and validated.
